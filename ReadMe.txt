Dissertation Based On Data Visualisation
  • Developed a system that captures motion data using the Kinect, Arduino and a Fitbit.
  • Stores data on a MySQL database and used D3.js and Tableau to create interactive
  visualisations.
  • Visualisations are embedded to an ASP.NET site which allows users to comment or create
  announcements based on their user privilege based on the visualisations.
  • The purpose of this project is to place the system into a care home where care home
  workers could decide if the general populous is having enough exercise.
  • Batch scripts was also created to allow some autonomous behaviour.
